# Project-1
Let's wrangle some data in Excel! We'll start by cleaning it up (trimming, fixing data types, removing duplicates), then dive into analysis (averages, quartiles, boxplots) using Data Analysis tools. Pivot tables will help us explore further, and finally, we'll build a report with formatting, lookups, and clever functions.
